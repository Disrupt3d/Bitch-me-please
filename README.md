<p align="center"> this app has been designed for the needs of the Hackaton 2 during our remote web app devlopper training session at the Wild Code School. We have been given 48 hours to produce a functional app, answering to  the  problem encountered by the partner company " Apside" .
They needed a tool , to increase the quality of communication  between their differents agencies accross the Europe,  making simple  the  share and  the sart of new projects.</p>
<p align="center">
With my group, composed by Clément Prémartin, Terry Grimoire,  Kévin Lavigne, Guillaume Guérit  and Ismael Agboubi  we decided to make it fun and with a different approach  than most of the groups:
Instead of proposing a tool to  create and share projects , we developed a concept which is about  giving credit to  gossips and rumors in the company.
we believe , that  thoses gossips can be a source of data really  usefull for the managers  and  can be used with intelligence to improve communication and encourage data sharing.
Here is our concept .
Of course its a  first try, and  there is a lot to be done  , especially adding  a backend  that we decided to  by-pass in order to  avoid time loss.
it has been fully coded using JavaScript, React,Tailwind, Bootstrap.</p><br/><br/>
